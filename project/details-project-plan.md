# Project Plan Submission and Rubric

## Deliverables

All deliverables will be in your team Github repo unless otherwise noted.

All deliverable documentation will be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Your Gantt chart will be produced in [YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/). Your presentation will be produced in whatever video recording software you prefer.

Your deliverables include:

1.  Introduction (Github)
2.  Team resumes (Github)
3.  Team assignments (Github)
4.  Technology selection (Github)
5.  Project plan milestones, epics and stories and Gantt chart (YouTrack)
6.  3-5 minute video presentation describing your plan, technology selection and team assignments (Github)

### Access to YouTrack

Jeff will provide each team with YouTrack accounts by Thursday, 9/28. Your YouTrack username will be your KSU email address. Your default YouTrack password will be **Swe3313!Fall2023**.

## Requirements

1.  [Very carefully read the Project Plan section in the main README file.](README.md#project-plan) 
    I recommend printing it and carefully highlighting/commenting everything in that section.
2.  Check all documentation into your team Github repo. Make sure all documentation is linked, organized, spell checked, and grammatically correct.
3.  Check your video presentation into your team Github repo. Create a folder called "presentations". Name the presentation "1-project-plan-presentation.[extension]" [Free Github accounts do not allow massive files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github), so be sure to compress your presentation a bit (not zipped [which won't help anyway] - [just shrink it to a smaller size where it's still high-resolution](https://multimedia.easeus.com/video-converter-tips/compress-video-vlc.html). Large files like video can be made to fit on Github easily, so be ready for this bit of effort if the original file is too big to check in without a bit of compression.

### Submission Steps

The entire team will work execute the Requirements. All of you need to review the completed work.

Once the requirements are complete, ***every* team member will do the following:** post a link to your team's Github repo in the Project Plan assignment in D2L before 11:59PM on Thursday, October 12, 2023.

If you forget to post your link in D2L, you will receive a late submission penalty (see syllabus). Do not rely on your teammates for this. Everyone must submit the link themselves (it's connected to the gradebook).

### Academic Honesty

Your work must be your own. Do not plagiarize under any circumstances. All work is subject to review by TurnItIn, etc.

More importantly, this course is a waste of your time if you do not do the work yourself. If you are tempted to cheat, you need to ask yourself why you are here and what you hope to accomplish in your career if you get the grade, but have minimal ability to perform the work after you leave the University.

### Team Grading

Everyone on the team will receive the same grade one exception. It follows.

Anyone not participating in the project may be removed from the team and have to perform the project alone. Before anyone can be "fired" from a team, I must meet with the *entire team* and hear what is happening. Do not fire anyone from your team without my explicit prior agreement.
